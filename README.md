# Fibonacci

The fibonacci sequence, done in as many programming languages that I can think of.

Keep in mind, that I don't know most these languages, and the code is most likely not the most efficient and best possible. I wrote these using whatever I could scrape from their documentation.

## What is the fibonacci sequence?

According to Wikipedia:

>In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted $F_n$, form a sequence, the **Fibonacci sequence**, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
